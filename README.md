 ## Conclusion
Even though this application would not replace the traditional methods completely, this project would eliminate most of the tedious tasks and is highly reliable, not only customers but also the organizations using this. With that being said, moving into the present online era people prefer booking tickets at their ease rather than physically going to a location for making their purchase.
